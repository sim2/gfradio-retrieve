Retrieve the value input into URL param to pre-select radio box

This is specifically geared for users that are utilizing Gravity Forms for payments. If you want to pre-select the radio box based on an ID value, this code is for you. 

First add a unique ID for each URL "button" link that you want to link to each Radio Box option. Then add the code in the script into the footer. (IE: you can use an Elementor HTML block, for example)
